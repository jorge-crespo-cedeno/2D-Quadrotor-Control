function [ u1, u2 ] = controller(~, state, des_state, params)
%CONTROLLER  Controller for the planar quadrotor
%
%   state: The current state of the robot with the following fields:
%   state.pos = [y; z], state.vel = [y_dot; z_dot], state.rot = [phi],
%   state.omega = [phi_dot]
%
%   des_state: The desired states are:
%   des_state.pos = [y; z], des_state.vel = [y_dot; z_dot], des_state.acc =
%   [y_ddot; z_ddot]
%
%   params: robot parameters

%   Using these current and desired states, you have to compute the desired
%   controls
